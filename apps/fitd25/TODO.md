    - [ ] In empty view, when waiting for challenge
    - [ ] When challenge is active and countdown is at 10 seconds or less
  - [ ] Add challenger name
    - [ ] Challenge view should allow the challenger to set the name when starting a challenge
  - [ ] When timer is up, the screen should be blocked until the admin clicks "next" (maybe per user)

- [ ] Admin view
  - [ ] Admin view should see the name of the challengers
  - [ ] Admin should be able to unblock the screen when the timer is up, per user
